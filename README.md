# Dessert Classification

## 1. Introduction

The **Dessert Classification** project aims to classify images of popular desserts into five categories: **cannoli**, **donuts**, **pancakes**, **tiramisu**, and **waffles**. This project is an extension of the [Replicating-ViT project](https://github.com/abhayrokkam/replicating-vit) and uses two different approaches for classification:

1. **Training a custom Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch.**
2. **Fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from `torchvision`.**

## 2. Highlights

- Classifying five different types of desserts.
- Exploring two training techniques: from-scratch and fine-tuning.
- Using a custom built vision transformer model for training from scratch.
- Explore the training results for both the techniques.
